           one user to see the one product and seeing side ad is another product to show some offer and less price that user buy only 1 prod and to see other prod automatically 2 r mre pd by to gets profits.

variability of data

Data source and data collection
 data can be sourced from social media platforms, third-party data providers, and internal sources. Utilize APIs, data scraping, surveys, and questionnaires for data collection.

pre-processing
Preprocessing means cleaning the data, processing text features (if present),addressing imbalanced data, selecting informative features, and splitting the dataset for training and testing.

feature extraction
the process of transforming raw data into numerical features while preserving the original data set's information.

random forest spl
Random Forest is handling high-dimensional data and capturing complex relationships.classification, regression and other task multiple decision trees to reach a single result. 

logistic regression  spl
one or more independent variables and a binary outcome using the logistic function. independent variables (predictors) and their corresponding dependent variables (responses) eg: success and failure

modeling 
Predictive modeling is a statistical technique that uses historical and current data to predict future outcomes

marketing and strategy
Marketing strategy formulation is the process of establishing a company's marketing goals and objectives. Marketing strategy execution is the process of turning a marketing strategy into action
