Problem of Study:
The problem revolves around predicting social media impact accurately to inform marketing strategies. This could include predicting the reach, engagement, or conversion rates of social media campaigns.

Why Chosen This Title:
The title aptly reflects the core objective of your study - enhancing prediction accuracy in social media impact analysis, which is crucial for effective marketing decisions.

Sample Size:
The sample size in your study would depend on various factors such as the volume of available data, the complexity of the models, and statistical considerations for ensuring reliability and generalizability of results.

About the Applications:
Your study's applications are significant for businesses and marketers aiming to optimize their social media marketing efforts. Accurate impact prediction can lead to better resource allocation, improved targeting, and ultimately, higher returns on investment.

Effective Communication of Results:
Communicating results effectively involves presenting findings clearly, using visualizations where necessary, and contextualizing the implications for marketing strategies. It's crucial to highlight the practical significance of the improvements achieved by your proposed methods.

About SPSS:
SPSS (Statistical Package for the Social Sciences) is a widely used software for statistical analysis. While it may not be the primary tool for machine learning, it can still be used for data preprocessing, descriptive statistics, and certain types of analysis.

What is p-value:
The p-value represents the probability of obtaining results as extreme as the observed results, assuming the null hypothesis is true. In your study, p-values would be used to assess the statistical significance of model performance improvements or differences between models.

What is ANOVA:
ANOVA (Analysis of Variance) is a statistical method used to compare means across two or more groups. In the context of your study, ANOVA could be used to compare the performance of different machine learning models (e.g., Random Forest vs. Logistic Regression) in predicting social media impact.

Applications of the Study:
The applications of your study extend to various industries and organizations that utilize social media for marketing purposes. These include e-commerce, entertainment, consumer goods, and more.

Algorithm Application:
Your study applies Random Forest and Logistic Regression algorithms to predict social media impact. Random Forest is known for handling high-dimensional data and capturing complex relationships, while Logistic Regression is interpretable and suitable for binary classification tasks like predicting the success or failure of marketing campaigns.

By addressing these points, you can provide a comprehensive overview of your study's objectives, methodology, findings, and practical implications.
